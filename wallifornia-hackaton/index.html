          <p>Streaming media is multimedia that is constantly received by and presented to an end-user while being
            delivered by a provider. The verb "to stream" refers to the process of delivering or obtaining media in this
            manner;[clarification needed] the term refers to the delivery method of the medium, rather than the medium
            itself, and is an alternative to file downloading, a process in which the end-user obtains the entire file
            for the content before watching or listening to it.

            A client end-user can use their media player to start playing digital video or digital audio content before
            the entire file has been transmitted. Distinguishing delivery method from the media distributed applies
            specifically to telecommunications networks, as most of the delivery systems are either inherently streaming
            (e.g. radio, television, streaming apps) or inherently non-streaming (e.g. books, video cassettes, audio
            CDs). For example, in the 1930s, elevator music was among the earliest popular music available as streaming
            media; nowadays Internet television is a common form of streamed media. The term "streaming media" can apply
            to media other than video and audio, such as live closed captioning, ticker tape, and real-time text, which
            are all considered "streaming text
